# Ignorancia Artificial ‚Äì BozoGPT

> "The first AI trained with public education and Mexican TV."

A humorous, sarcastic, and absurd chatbot built with Next.js (App Router), TailwindCSS, and OpenAI API. BozoGPT always answers with creative, funny, or nonsensical responses whose only purpose is to say "I don't know"‚Äînever anything useful or true. Inspired by the ChatGPT UI, but with a comic twist.

## üîê Environment Variables

- `OPENAI_API_KEY` ‚Äì Your OpenAI API key (required, never exposed to frontend)

---

## üß† How it works
- The frontend detects the user's language and sends it to the backend.
- The backend (`/api/chat`) acts as a secure proxy to OpenAI, injecting a system prompt that forces absurd, comic, and "I don't know" answers in the user's language.
- The frontend UI is inspired by ChatGPT, but with a comic, minimal, and dark look.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Issues

### Opera Mobile Browser
**Problem**: When the virtual keyboard appears in Opera mobile, the content may be pushed up and become partially hidden, leaving empty space at the bottom of the screen.

**Status**: This is a known browser limitation/bug in Opera mobile. The app includes Opera-specific fixes (`OperaViewportJSFix.tsx`) but the issue may persist due to Opera's viewport handling.

**Workaround**: For the best mobile experience, we recommend using Chrome, Firefox, or Edge on mobile devices.

**Technical Details**: 
- Opera mobile has inconsistent behavior with `window.innerHeight` and viewport units when the virtual keyboard is active
- The app attempts to fix this with JavaScript viewport adjustments, but Opera may ignore these changes
- This is not a bug in the application code, but a limitation of the Opera mobile browser
